, this project endeavours to put together a general purpose citizen science web-portal implementation that can be used by organisations and special interest groups to set up a citizen science project and collect biological observation data.

The project was initatied by the <a href='http://www.ala.org.au'>Atlas of Living Australia</a> (ALA) and has gone on to be used by a range of other commercial, government and not-for-profit institutions as well.  Funding for this project, while originally from the ALA, now comes from a range of different sources.

Some milestones for this project include:

  * The first release of the code was placed on this site on 29th April, 2011.
  * Version 1.0 of the code was uploaded on 20th December, 2011.

Further releases and additional resources will be uploaded to this site in the first half of 2012.
